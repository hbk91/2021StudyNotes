### Key Challenges
- **High Costs**: The U.S. spends nearly twice as much on healthcare compared to other wealthy nations, driven largely by high hospital service, drug, and care costs.
- **Fragmented System**: Unlike other nations with centralized healthcare systems, the U.S. developed a patchwork system reliant on employer-sponsored insurance and private insurers.
- **Profit-Driven Model**: America's healthcare system incentivizes spending and charging more rather than cost containment.

### Historical Background
- Employer-sponsored insurance became common during World War II as a tax-free benefit to attract workers.
- Programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) were introduced later to cover gaps, but the system remains decentralized.

### Systemic Issues
- **Insurers' Profit Motive**: Insurance companies often overbill the government, cut patient care, and engage in self-dealing through vertically integrated structures.
- **Patient Burden**: Employers and government policies have shifted costs to patients via higher premiums, copays, and deductibles, known as "having skin in the game."
- **Prior Authorization**: This process requires insurer approval before certain medical treatments, often delaying or denying care.

### Possible Reforms
- **Better Regulation**: Clear rules to define insurer practices and enforce transparency could reduce inefficiencies.
- **Streamlined Processes**: Simplifying prior authorization could alleviate frustrations for patients and providers.
- **Government Oversight**: Agencies like the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have proposed rules to improve fairness and reduce unnecessary barriers.

### Broader Observations
- In other countries, healthcare costs are lower due to tighter regulation and alignment between providers and insurers.
- The U.S. system leaves patients caught between providers aiming to maximize payments and insurers trying to control costs.
