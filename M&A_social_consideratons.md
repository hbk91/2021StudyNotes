# CEO Compensation in Bank M&A: Change-in-Control & New Arrangements

When a bank is acquired, the target CEO often receives a mix of **Change-in-Control (CiC) payments**, **retention incentives**, and **new employment or consulting arrangements**. Below are the major categories and terminology you’ll see in S-4 filings and merger proxy statements.

---

## I. **Change-in-Control (CiC) Payments**

Designed to protect executives from job loss or demotion following a merger.

### 1. **Cash Severance**
- **Definition:** Lump-sum payment, often **2×–3×** base salary plus target bonus.  
- **Trigger:** Termination *without cause* or *for good reason* within a set period post-closing (“double trigger”).  

---

### 2. **Acceleration of Equity Awards**
- **Definition:** Immediate vesting (“acceleration”) of unvested stock options, RSUs, or PSUs.  
- **Types:**  
  - *Single trigger:* Vests at closing.  
  - *Double trigger:* Vests only if terminated post-deal.  
- **Purpose:** Prevents loss of unvested equity upon merger.

---

### 3. **Excise Tax Gross-Up** *(rare now)*
- **Definition:** Company reimburses any 280G excise taxes from excessive parachute payments.  
- **Status:** Largely phased out due to shareholder pressure.

---

### 4. **Retention Bonus (Stay Bonus)**
- **Definition:** Incentive to remain through closing or integration milestones.  
- **Payment Timing:** Typically 6–12 months after closing if still employed.  
- **Goal:** Ensure continuity and smooth integration.

---

## II. **New Employment or Consulting Arrangements**

Formalizes the CEO’s post-closing role in the combined institution.

### 5. **Employment Agreement with Combined Company**
- **Definition:** Guarantees title, duties, compensation post-merger (e.g., *Vice Chair* or *Regional CEO*).  
- **Terms Usually Include:**  
  - Base salary  
  - Annual bonus opportunity  
  - Long-term incentive eligibility  
  - Severance protection

---

### 6. **Consulting or Advisory Agreement**
- **Definition:** Short-term consulting role (6–24 months).  
- **Structure:** Retainer fees (monthly or lump sum).  
- **Purpose:** Provide continuity and regulatory relationship support.

---

## III. **Other Deal-Related Considerations**

### 7. **Transaction Bonus**
- **Definition:** One-time cash award for successfully completing the merger.  
- **Paid:** At or near closing.  
- **May Be Structured As:** Fixed amount or % of deal value.

---

### 8. **Non-Compete / Non-Solicit Payment**
- **Definition:** Separate consideration for agreeing to restrictive covenants post-merger.  
- **Use Case:** CEO not retained but restricted from competing.  
- **Form:** Lump sum or periodic payments.

---

### 9. **Deferred Compensation & SERP Payouts**
- **Definition:** Acceleration or lump-sum payment of Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) or deferred compensation balances.  
- **Trigger:** Change-in-control event.

---

## V. **Workflow:**

# Step-by-Step Workflow: Finding CEO CiC & New-Comp Details in Bank M&A

This workflow shows exactly where and how to pull **change-in-control (CiC)** payments, **retention/transaction bonuses**, **equity acceleration**, and **new employment/consulting** terms for a **target bank CEO**.

---

## 1) Go to SEC EDGAR (Company Search)
- Open: https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html
- In **Company and Person Lookup**, type the **target bank’s legal name** or **ticker**.
  - Tip: If the bank is private, search the **holding company** name listed in press releases.

---

## 2) Filter to the Right Filing Types
In the results, use **Filter by filing type** (upper left) and run these, in order:
1. **S-4** (or **S-4/A**) — joint proxy/prospectus for the merger  
2. **8-K** (around **announcement** and **closing**) — deal terms + exhibits  
3. **DEF 14A** (latest proxy before deal) — baseline comp & plans  
4. **10-K / 10-Q** — equity plan mechanics, definitions

---

## 3) Open the S-4 and Jump to the Right Sections
Inside the **S-4**, use **Ctrl + F** for these strings:
- **“Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger”**
- **“Golden Parachute Compensation—Quantification of Payments and Benefits”** (Item 402(t))
- **“Change in Control Arrangements”**
- **“Employment Agreement”**, **“Consulting Agreement”**
- **“Non-competition”** or **“Restrictive covenants”**

> You should find **tables** titled *“Golden Parachute Compensation”* or *“Estimated Payments and Benefits to Named Executive Officers”* with **CEO** line items.

---

## 4) Capture the Quantified CEO Amounts
From the S-4 **tables + footnotes**, grab:
- **Cash severance** (often 2–3× base + target bonus; note **single vs double trigger**)
- **Equity acceleration** (RSUs/PSUs/options vesting; look for valuation method)
- **Retention / stay bonus** (timing conditions: e.g., 6–12 months post-close)
- **Transaction/completion bonus** (paid at or near close)
- **Non-compete/non-solicit consideration** (if separately quantified)
- **280G** (excise tax **gross-up** present? usually **no** in modern bank deals)

> **Tip:** Footnotes often explain **timing**, **triggers**, and **valuation dates**—copy those exact phrases.

---

## 5) Pull the Definitions and Triggers from the Merger Agreement
Still in EDGAR:
- In the S-4 **“Exhibits”** section or the **announcement 8-K**, open **Exhibit 2.1 (Agreement and Plan of Merger)**.
- **Ctrl + F** for: **“Change in Control”**, **“Good Reason”**, **“Cause”**, **“Severance”**, **“Treatment of Company Equity Awards”**.
- Note **double-trigger** vs **single-trigger** language and any **integration milestones** tied to retention.

---

## 6) Retrieve the Actual Employment/Consulting Contracts (If Referenced)
- From the S-4 or 8-K **exhibit index**, open **Exhibit 10.x** items:
  - **Employment Agreement** (post-close role/title, base, bonus target, LTI, severance)
  - **Consulting/Advisory Agreement** (term, monthly retainer, scope)
  - **Non-compete/Non-solicit Agreement** (duration, geography, consideration)
- Record **effective dates**, **payment schedules**, and **termination provisions**.

---

## 7) Cross-Check Baseline Comp in the Latest DEF 14A (Proxy)
- Open most recent **DEF 14A** (pre-deal).
- Copy **CEO base salary**, **target bonus opportunity**, and **equity mix** (helps validate the S-4 severance math).
- Note any **SERP/Deferred comp** plans and **vesting rules**.

---

## 8) Scan the 8-Ks Around Announcement and Closing
- **Announcement 8-K**: look for **Item 1.01** (material agreements) and **exhibits** summarizing negotiated CEO roles (e.g., *Vice Chair, Regional President*).
- **Closing 8-K**: sometimes files **final forms** of employment/consulting agreements and **restrictive covenants**.

---

## 9) (If Needed) Check 10-K/10-Q for Plan Mechanics
- For **equity plan** definitions (change-in-control treatment, valuation), search the **Equity Incentive Plan** sections and related **exhibits**.

---

## 10) Build Your “Social Considerations” Table in Excel
Recommended columns (rows = deals):
- **CEO Name | New Role/Title | Board Seat? | Cash Severance ($) | Equity Acceleration ($) | Retention/Stay Bonus ($) | Transaction Bonus ($) | Non-Compete ($) | Consulting ($ & Term) | 280G Gross-Up? | Triggers (Single/Double) | Key Footnotes (Timing/Valuation) | Sources (Form, Date, Page/Exhibit)**

> Paste exact **page numbers/exhibit numbers** next to each data point for auditability.

---

## 11) Normalize & Reconcile
- Align **valuation dates** (e.g., “assumes closing on MM/DD/YYYY and stock price of $X.XX”).
- Confirm **which awards** accelerate (time-based vs performance-based; performance assumption used).
- Reconcile any differences between **S-4 table** totals and **exhibit** terms.

---

## 12) Document Triggers Clearly
- Label **Double Trigger** = CiC **and** qualifying termination (without cause / for good reason) within protection period (e.g., 12–24 months).
- Label **Single Trigger** = benefits at **closing** regardless of termination.
- Flag **retention** timing (e.g., payable **6 or 12 months post-close** if still employed).

---

## 13) Save Citations for Each Entry
- Record: **Form type**, **filing date**, **page number**, **section header**, **exhibit number**.
- Example citation: “S-4 filed **2025-03-12**, p. 155 ‘Golden Parachute Compensation’; **Ex. 2.1** Merger Agreement §§1.7, 5.4; **Ex. 10.3** CEO Employment Agreement.”

---

## 14) Sanity-Check with Press Releases / IR Pages
- Acquirer/target **Investor Relations** pages often summarize **post-close roles** (e.g., “Target CEO to serve as Vice Chair”).
- Use these only as **secondary confirmation**; **EDGAR controls**.

---

## 15) Final Review Checklist (Yes/No)
- ☐ CEO **cash severance** captured (multiplier & basis)  
- ☐ **Equity acceleration** amounts & performance assumptions noted  
- ☐ **Retention/transaction** bonuses and timing recorded  
- ☐ **Non-compete/consulting** consideration and **term** captured  
- ☐ **Triggers** (single/double) and **protection period** documented  
- ☐ **Exhibit** numbers and **page citations** logged  
- ☐ Numbers reconcile to S-4 **golden parachute table** totals
