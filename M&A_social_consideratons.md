# 🏦 CEO Compensation in Bank M&A: Change-in-Control & New Arrangements

When a bank is acquired, the target CEO often receives a mix of **Change-in-Control (CiC) payments**, **retention incentives**, and **new employment or consulting arrangements**. Below are the major categories and terminology you’ll see in S-4 filings and merger proxy statements.

---

## I. **Change-in-Control (CiC) Payments**

Designed to protect executives from job loss or demotion following a merger.

### 1. **Cash Severance**
- **Definition:** Lump-sum payment, often **2×–3×** base salary plus target bonus.  
- **Trigger:** Termination *without cause* or *for good reason* within a set period post-closing (“double trigger”).  
- **Formula:**  
  \[
  \text{CiC Severance} = (2\text{ or }3) \times (\text{Base Salary} + \text{Target Bonus})
  \]

### 2. **Acceleration of Equity Awards**
- **Definition:** Immediate vesting (“acceleration”) of unvested stock options, RSUs, or PSUs.  
- **Types:**  
  - *Single trigger:* Vests at closing.  
  - *Double trigger:* Vests only if terminated post-deal.  
- **Purpose:** Prevents loss of unvested equity upon merger.

### 3. **Excise Tax Gross-Up** *(rare now)*
- **Definition:** Company reimburses any 280G excise taxes from excessive parachute payments.  
- **Status:** Largely phased out due to shareholder pressure.

### 4. **Retention Bonus (Stay Bonus)**
- **Definition:** Incentive to remain through closing or integration milestones.  
- **Payment Timing:** Typically 6–12 months after closing if still employed.

## II. **New Employment or Consulting Arrangements**

Formalizes the CEO’s post-closing role in the combined institution.

### 5. **Employment Agreement with Combined Company**

- **Terms Usually Include:**  
  - Base salary

- **May Be Structured As:** Fixed amount or % of deal value.
