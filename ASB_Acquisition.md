## **Deal Rationale**

*Dec, 2024*

### **1. Financial Stabilization for Hawaiian Electric Industries (HEI)**
- HEI faces significant financial obligations, including a nearly $2 billion settlement related to the 2023 Maui wildfires.
- Proceeds from the sale will strengthen HEI’s balance sheet, providing resources to address ongoing legal and financial challenges.
- The retained 9.9% stake allows HEI to maintain a minor interest in ASB, preserving some long-term value.

### **2. Focus on Core Utility Operations**
- By divesting the banking business, HEI can streamline its operations and focus exclusively on its core utility services.
- The deal enables HEI to concentrate on rebuilding public trust and enhancing infrastructure reliability in the aftermath of the wildfires.

### **3. Ensuring Continuity and Local Leadership at ASB**
- ASB retains its current management team, led by CEO Ann Teranishi, ensuring stability during the transition.
- The investor group is structured to prevent any single entity from dominating, maintaining ASB’s local roots and independence.

### **4. Alignment with Market Dynamics**
- The sale aligns with HEI’s long-term strategy of separating its utility and banking operations, reflecting industry trends.
- ASB’s new investors bring a mix of capital and expertise, potentially unlocking growth opportunities for the bank.
