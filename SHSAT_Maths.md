   - Unwatered fraction = **1 - 2/3 = 1/3**

---

### **Trail 2: 💧✨ Measuring the Fountain’s Flow ✨💧 - Decimals**

#### **Rules of the Trail**
Decimals are another way to express parts of a whole, often used in measurements. For example, if the fountain’s diameter is 2.75 meters, the ".75" represents three-quarters of a meter.

#### **Adventurer’s Guide**

**Trail Marker 1:**  
   The fountain’s height is 3.25 meters. Express this as a mixed number.  
   **Solution:**  
   - 3 = whole meters  
   - 0.25 = **1/4** of a meter  
   - Height = **3 1/4 meters**

**Trail Marker 2:**  
   The water flow reduces from 1.5 liters per minute to 0.8 liters per minute. By how much was the flow reduced?  
   **Solution:**  
   - Initial flow = **1.5 liters**  
   - Final flow = **0.8 liters**  
   - Reduction = **1.5 - 0.8 = 0.7 liters**

---

### **Trail 3: 🌳🧮 Dividing the Fountain’s Space 🧮🌳 - Ratios**

#### **Adventurer’s Guide**

**Trail Marker 1:**  
   Solve for \( x \):  
   \( 4x - 2 > 10 \)  
   **Solution:**  
   - Add 2 to both sides: \( 4x > 12 \)  
   - Divide both sides by 4: \( x > 3 \)

**Trail Marker 2:**  
   Solve for \( y \):  
   \( -3y + 5 \leq 14 \)  
   **Solution:**  
   - Subtract 5 from both sides: \( -3y \leq 9 \)  
   - Divide both sides by -3 and flip the sign: \( y \geq -3 \)
