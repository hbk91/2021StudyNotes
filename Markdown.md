## Best Practices for Bullet Points and Code Blocks in Markdown

| **Practice**                              | **Bullet Points**                                                                                          | **Code Blocks**                                                                                                                                                         |

| **Blank Line Before Starting**            | Always leave a blank line before bullet points to avoid misinterpretation as a code block.                  | Leave a blank line before a code block to separate it from the previous text.                                                                                           |
| **Consistent Indentation**                | Use consistent indentation for nested bullet points (e.g., two spaces or tabs).                            | Use at least four spaces or triple backticks (\`\`\`) for multi-line code blocks.                                                                                       |
| **Proper Symbol for Bullets**             | Use `-`, `*`, or `+` for bullet points, but donâ€™t mix them within the same list.                           | Use triple backticks (\`\`\`) for code fences or indent the block with four spaces for inline formatting.                                                               |
| **Avoid Indentation Before the List**     | Ensure bullet points start at the left margin (unless nested).                                              | Indent code blocks only if inside a list or other structured content.                                                                                                   |
| **Escape Special Characters**             | Escape characters like `*`, `_`, or `-` with a backslash (`\`) if needed within the text.                  | No need to escape special characters inside code blocks; they are treated as plain text.                                                                                |
| **Inline Code within Bullet Points**      | Use single backticks (\`) for inline code: `\`like this\``.                                                | Use single backticks for inline code snippets or special keywords.                                                                                                      |
| **Numbered Lists with Code Blocks**       | For numbered lists, start each item with a number and ensure no empty line between the number and the code. | Indent the code block under the numbered item with at least four spaces, or use triple backticks inside the item for clean formatting.                                  |
| **Avoid Over-Indentation**                | Do not over-indent bullet points to avoid accidental interpretation as a code block.                       | Ensure proper alignment when nesting code blocks within bullet points.                                                                                                 |
