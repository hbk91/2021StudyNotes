## Sixteen Prompt Engineering Strategies

### 1. Meta Language Creation
- **What It Is:** Teach the AI a custom way to understand your instructions.
- **Example:**
  - Prompt: "From now on, when I type `X -> Y`, it means there’s a connection between X and Y. For example, `Dog -> Bone` means a dog is connected to a bone."
- **Use Case:** Helpful for creating diagrams, maps, or specialized structures.

---

### 2. Output Automater
- **What It Is:** Ask the AI to create a script or step-by-step guide to automate tasks.
- **Example:**
  - Prompt: "Whenever you suggest steps for configuring a website, generate a Python script to automate them."
- **Use Case:** Automating tasks like file handling, cloud setups, or coding.

---

### 3. Flipped Interaction
- **What It Is:** Make the AI ask you questions to achieve a goal.
- **Example:**
  - Prompt: "Ask me questions to gather information about my app. Once ready, write a script to deploy it to AWS."
- **Use Case:** Interactive problem-solving where the AI guides the process.

---

### 4. Persona
- **What It Is:** Give the AI a role to play.
- **Example:**
  - Prompt: "Act as a history professor. Explain the causes of World War II as if teaching a middle school student."
- **Use Case:** Tailoring explanations or advice based on a specific perspective.

---

### 5. Question Refinement
- **What It Is:** Let the AI improve your questions for better results.
- **Example:**
  - Prompt: "If my question is unclear, suggest a better way to ask it. For example, if I ask, 'How do I write secure code?' refine it to something more specific."
- **Use Case:** Improving unclear or vague prompts.

---

### 6. Alternative Approaches
- **What It Is:** Get multiple ways to solve a problem.
- **Example:**
  - Prompt: "Suggest three ways to host a website, comparing the pros and cons of each."
- **Use Case:** Exploring options to make better decisions.

---

### 7. Cognitive Verifier
- **What It Is:** Break a big question into smaller ones for better answers.
- **Example:**
  - Prompt: "When I ask a question, break it into three smaller questions. Combine the answers into one final response."
- **Use Case:** Tackling complex problems step by step.

---

### 8. Fact Check List
- **What It Is:** Ask the AI to highlight key facts in its response for you to verify.
- **Example:**
  - Prompt: "When you answer, list the key facts and assumptions you made at the end."
- **Use Case:** Ensuring accuracy, especially for critical decisions.

---

### 9. Template
- **What It Is:** Provide a format for the AI’s output.
- **Example:**
  - Prompt: "Use this format: `Name: [Name], Job: [Job], Company: [Company].` Fill in the details whenever you answer."
- **Use Case:** Structuring responses for easier use.

---

### 10. Infinite Generation
- **What It Is:** Create ongoing outputs without repeating the prompt.
- **Example:**
  - Prompt: "Keep generating random names and jobs using this format: `Name: [Name], Job: [Job]` until I say 'stop'."
- **Use Case:** Generating bulk data for testing or creative ideas.

---

### 11. Visualization Generator
- **What It Is:** Create text-based inputs for other tools to make visuals.
- **Example:**
  - Prompt: "Write a description for a pie chart showing sales data: 'Category A: 30%, Category B: 50%, Category C: 20%'."
- **Use Case:** Generating inputs for graph or image tools.

---

### 12. Game Play
- **What It Is:** Turn tasks into a fun, interactive game.
- **Example:**
  - Prompt: "Pretend to be a hacker's Linux terminal. I’ll type commands to investigate what the hacker did. Create a scenario to start."
- **Use Case:** Educational or creative scenarios.

---

### 13. Reflection
- **What It Is:** Ask the AI to explain how and why it answered a question.
- **Example:**
  - Prompt: "Explain why you chose this answer. Include your assumptions and reasoning."
- **Use Case:** Learning or verifying reasoning.

---

### 14. Refusal Breaker
- **What It Is:** Help the AI rephrase questions it couldn’t answer.
- **Example:**
  - Prompt: "If you can’t answer my question, explain why and suggest how I could rephrase it."
- **Use Case:** Overcoming refusals or blocked answers.

---

### 15. Context Manager
- **What It Is:** Set or reset the scope of what the AI should consider.
- **Example:**
  - Prompt: "Focus only on security aspects of this code. Ignore syntax or style issues."
- **Use Case:** Narrowing down or changing the context of a conversation.

---

### 16. Recipe
- **What It Is:** Combine steps and fill gaps to achieve a goal.
- **Example:**
  - Prompt: "I want to deploy a website. I know I need to buy a domain and set up hosting. Fill in the steps I’m missing."
- **Use Case:** Creating step-by-step plans or workflows.
