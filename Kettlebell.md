## Kettlebell

A **kettlebell** is a versatile piece of workout equipment shaped like a cannonball with a handle. It originated in Russia and has been used for centuries as a tool for building strength, endurance, and flexibility. Kettlebells come in various weights, making them suitable for beginners and advanced fitness enthusiasts alike.

The unique design of the kettlebell, with its off-center weight distribution, challenges your body differently than traditional dumbbells or barbells. This feature makes kettlebells particularly effective for dynamic and functional movements.
