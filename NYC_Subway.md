## **Relationship Between Numbering and Color Coding**

1. **Color Coding:**
   - Each color represents a **trunk line** (a central route shared by multiple services) in Manhattan.
   - For example:
     - **Red**: The 1, 2, and 3 trains all use the **Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line** in Manhattan.
     - **Green**: The 4, 5, and 6 trains all use the **Lexington Avenue Line** in Manhattan.
   - This helps passengers identify which trains follow similar paths through central areas of the city.

2. **Numbering (or Lettering):**
   - Each number or letter represents a **specific service** (a distinct route with defined stops and endpoints) that operates on a trunk line.
   - For example:
     - The **1** train runs local, while the **2** and **3** trains run express on the same red-colored trunk line.

3. **Combining Color and Numbering:**
   - The color provides a high-level guide to the trunk line.
   - The number or letter distinguishes between local, express, or unique routes on that trunk.

### **Key Examples**

| **Color**   | **Number/Letter** | **Trunk Line**                           | **Service Notes**                              |
|-------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Red**     | 1, 2, 3            | Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line             | 1 is local, 2 and 3 are express.              |
| **Green**   | 4, 5, 6            | Lexington Avenue Line                    | 6 is local, 4 and 5 are express.              |
| **Blue**    | A, C, E            | Eighth Avenue Line                       | A is express, C is local, E serves Queens.    |
| **Orange**  | B, D, F, M         | Sixth Avenue Line                        | Services split after Manhattan.               |
| **Yellow**  | N, Q, R, W         | Broadway Line                            | N and Q are express, R and W are local.       |
| **Purple**  | 7                  | Flushing Line                            | 7 offers local and express services.          |
| **Gray**    | S (Shuttle)        | Varies (e.g., 42nd St, Franklin Ave)     | Short-distance shuttle routes.                |

### **How Color and Numbering Help Passengers**

- **Color**:
  - Guides passengers to the trunk line, useful for navigating **Manhattan** where many lines converge.
  - Example: All green trains (4, 5, 6) run along Lexington Avenue.
  
- **Number/Letter**:
  - Helps passengers distinguish specific services on the same line.
  - Example: The **1** stops at all local stations on the red line, but the **2** skips certain stops as an express.

### **Why This System is Effective**

The dual-use of color coding for trunk lines and numbers/letters for specific services:

1. Reduces confusion in complex areas with overlapping routes (like Midtown Manhattan).
2. Allows flexibility for service adjustments (e.g., express or local changes) without altering the overall color-coded map.
