### **Issued Stock vs. Outstanding Stock: Key Differences**

| **Category**       | **Issued Stock** | **Outstanding Stock** |
|--------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| **Definition**     | Total number of shares a company has ever sold (includes both outstanding shares and treasury stock). | Total number of shares held by investors (excludes treasury stock). |
| **Includes Treasury Stock?** | **Yes**, includes both shares held by investors and repurchased shares (treasury stock). | **No**, excludes treasury stock since those shares are held by the company itself. |
| **Held by Investors?** | **Not necessarily**â€”some issued shares may be repurchased by the company and held as treasury stock. | **Yes**, outstanding stock consists only of shares that are currently in the hands of investors. |
| **Used to Calculate EPS?** | **No**, issued stock is not used for EPS calculations. | **Yes**, outstanding stock is used in EPS (Earnings Per Share) calculations. |
| **Can Change Over Time?** | Yes, if the company issues new shares or buys back shares. | Yes, when companies issue new shares or repurchase shares. |

### **Formula Relationship**
\[
\text{Issued Stock} = \text{Outstanding Stock} + \text{Treasury Stock}
\]

### **Example**
- A company initially issues **1,000,000 shares**.
- Over time, it **buys back 200,000 shares**, which become **treasury stock**.
- The **outstanding shares** now equal **800,000**.

**Thus:**

\[
1,000,000 \text{ (Issued Stock)} = 800,000 \text{ (Outstanding Stock)} + 200,000 \text{ (Treasury Stock)}
\]
