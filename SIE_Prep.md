### **Issued Stock vs. Outstanding Stock: Key Differences**

| **Category**       | **Issued Stock** | **Outstanding Stock** |
|--------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| **Definition**     | Total number of shares a company has ever sold (includes both outstanding shares and treasury stock). | Total number of shares held by investors (excludes treasury stock). |
| **Includes Treasury Stock?** | **Yes**, includes both shares held by investors and repurchased shares (treasury stock). | **No**, excludes treasury stock since those shares are held by the company itself. |
| **Held by Investors?** | **Not necessarily**—some issued shares may be repurchased by the company and held as treasury stock. | **Yes**, outstanding stock consists only of shares that are currently in the hands of investors. |
| **Used to Calculate EPS?** | **No**, issued stock is not used for EPS calculations. | **Yes**, outstanding stock is used in EPS (Earnings Per Share) calculations. |
| **Can Change Over Time?** | Yes, if the company issues new shares or buys back shares. | Yes, when companies issue new shares or repurchase shares. |

### **Formula Relationship**

### **Formula Relationship**
$$
\text{Issued Stock} = \text{Outstanding Stock} + \text{Treasury Stock}
$$

### **Example**
- A company initially issues **1,000,000 shares**.
- Over time, it **buys back 200,000 shares**, which become **treasury stock**.
- The **outstanding shares** now equal **800,000**.

Thus:

$$
1,000,000 \text{ (Issued Stock)} = 800,000 \text{ (Outstanding Stock)} + 200,000 \text{ (Treasury Stock)}
$$

### **Statutory Voting vs. Cumulative Voting**

| **Feature**           | **Statutory Voting** | **Cumulative Voting** |
|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Definition**       | A shareholder must vote the same number of shares for each board seat available. | A shareholder can allocate their total votes freely among one or more candidates. |
| **Formula for Total Votes** | **Shares Owned × Number of Seats Available** | **Shares Owned × Number of Seats Available** (same as statutory voting) |
| **Voting Flexibility** | **Less flexible**—votes must be split evenly across all candidates. | **More flexible**—votes can be concentrated on one or a few candidates. |
| **Effect on Minority Shareholders** | **Less favorable**—majority shareholders have stronger control over the board. | **More favorable**—allows minority shareholders to increase their influence by pooling votes on specific candidates. |
| **Common Use Case** | More common in **large corporations** where majority shareholders prefer control. | Often used in companies where **protecting minority shareholders** is a priority. |
| **Example** | If a shareholder owns **1,000 shares** and there are **3 board seats**, they can cast **1,000 votes per seat**. | If a shareholder owns **1,000 shares** and there are **3 board seats**, they have **3,000 total votes** and can distribute them as they wish (e.g., all 3,000 votes to one candidate). |

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Statutory voting** benefits **majority shareholders**, ensuring their preferred candidates win.
- **Cumulative voting** benefits **minority shareholders**, giving them a chance to elect at least one board member.
