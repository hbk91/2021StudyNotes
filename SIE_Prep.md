### **Issued Stock vs. Outstanding Stock: Key Differences**

| **Category**       | **Issued Stock** | **Outstanding Stock** |
|--------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| **Definition**     | Total number of shares a company has ever sold (includes both outstanding shares and treasury stock). | Total number of shares held by investors (excludes treasury stock). |
| **Includes Treasury Stock?** | **Yes**, includes both shares held by investors and repurchased shares (treasury stock). | **No**, excludes treasury stock since those shares are held by the company itself. |
| **Held by Investors?** | **Not necessarily**—some issued shares may be repurchased by the company and held as treasury stock. | **Yes**, outstanding stock consists only of shares that are currently in the hands of investors. |
| **Used to Calculate EPS?** | **No**, issued stock is not used for EPS calculations. | **Yes**, outstanding stock is used in EPS (Earnings Per Share) calculations. |
| **Can Change Over Time?** | Yes, if the company issues new shares or buys back shares. | Yes, when companies issue new shares or repurchase shares. |

### **Formula Relationship**

**Issued Stock = Outstanding Stock + Treasury Stock**

### **Example**
- A company initially issues **1,000,000 shares**.
- Over time, it **buys back 200,000 shares**, which become **treasury stock**.
- The **outstanding shares** now equal **800,000**.

**Thus:**

**1,000,000 (Issued Stock) = 800,000 (Outstanding Stock) + 200,000 (Treasury Stock)**

### **Statutory Voting vs. Cumulative Voting**

| **Feature**           | **Statutory Voting** | **Cumulative Voting** |
|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Definition**       | A shareholder must vote the same number of shares for each board seat available. | A shareholder can allocate their total votes freely among one or more candidates. |
| **Formula for Total Votes** | **Shares Owned × Number of Seats Available** | **Shares Owned × Number of Seats Available** (same as statutory voting) |
| **Voting Flexibility** | **Less flexible**—votes must be split evenly across all candidates. | **More flexible**—votes can be concentrated on one or a few candidates. |
| **Effect on Minority Shareholders** | **Less favorable**—majority shareholders have stronger control over the board. | **More favorable**—allows minority shareholders to increase their influence by pooling votes on specific candidates. |
| **Common Use Case** | More common in **large corporations** where majority shareholders prefer control. | Often used in companies where **protecting minority shareholders** is a priority. |
| **Example** | If a shareholder owns **1,000 shares** and there are **3 board seats**, they can cast **1,000 votes per seat**. | If a shareholder owns **1,000 shares** and there are **3 board seats**, they have **3,000 total votes** and can distribute them as they wish (e.g., all 3,000 votes to one candidate). |

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Statutory voting** benefits **majority shareholders**, ensuring their preferred candidates win.
- **Cumulative voting** benefits **minority shareholders**, giving them a chance to elect at least one board member.

### **Board Elections: Typical Frequency, Board Size, and Candidate Contests**  

The **number of candidates per board seat**, the **frequency of elections**, and **board size** vary depending on company size and governance practices.  

### **1. Board Elections Frequency**  
- **Most common: Annual elections** (though some companies have staggered terms).  
- **Staggered (Classified) Boards:** Some companies elect **one-third of the board** every year to prevent hostile takeovers.  

### **2. Board Size & Number of Candidates per Seat (Large Cap vs. Mid-Market vs. Small Cap)**  

| **Company Size** | **Typical Board Size** | **Number of Candidates per Seat** | **Election Frequency** |
|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Large-Cap (S&P 500 firms)** | 9 - 15 directors | Usually 1-2 per seat (often unopposed) | Annual or staggered (every 3 years for a third of the board) |
| **Mid-Market ($500M - $5B valuation)** | 7 - 11 directors | Usually 1-3 per seat (depends on activist investors) | Annual or staggered |
| **Small-Cap (< $500M valuation)** | 5 - 9 directors | 1-5 per seat (sometimes competitive, especially in contested elections) | Annual |

### **3. Candidate Contests: How Many People Run for a Seat?**
- **Most common:** **1 candidate per seat** (the board nominates a candidate who is usually elected uncontested).  
- **In contested elections:** **2-5 candidates per seat**, especially when activist investors push for board changes.  
- **Hostile Takeover/Proxy Fight:** Can have **multiple candidates per seat** (e.g., **activist hedge funds** nominate their own directors to challenge management).  

### **4. Real-World Examples**  

#### **Large-Cap Example: Apple Inc. (AAPL)**
- **Board size:** 8-12 members.  
- **Election frequency:** **Annual elections**.  
- **Candidates per seat:** Typically **one nominee per seat** (low competition).  
- **Voting type:** Statutory voting.  

#### **Mid-Market Example: Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS)**
- **Board size:** 7-10 members.  
- **Election frequency:** **Annual or staggered**.  
- **Candidates per seat:** Usually **1-2 per seat**, but can increase in activist-driven cases.  

#### **Small-Cap Example: A Startup-turned-Public Company (e.g., Etsy in its early public years)**
- **Board size:** 5-9 members.  
- **Election frequency:** Annual.  
- **Candidates per seat:** 1-5 (more competition, more influence from activist investors).  

### **5. Key Takeaways**
1. **Larger companies tend to have fewer candidates per seat** (management’s nominees are rarely challenged).  
2. **Smaller companies are more likely to see contested board elections.**  
3. **Board size decreases as company size decreases**, with small-cap companies having **5-9 directors** and large-cap companies having **9-15 directors**.  
4. **Elections are usually annual**, but staggered boards spread elections over three years.
