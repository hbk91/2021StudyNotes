### A. Project 1: Building a Movie Review Sentiment Classifier

The following are the key learnings:

1. Building and training a LSTM Network (100 cell single layer) using PyTorch. <a href="https://pythonprogramming.net/training-deep-learning-neural-network-pytorch/" target="_blank">This link</a> explains the basics of making a model with PyTorch.
2. AWS SageMaker.
3. Deploying the ML Model.
4. Building an AWS Lambda Function.
5. Building an AWS API Gateway.
  
### B. Project 2: Population Segmentation using SageMaker

The following are the key learnings:

1. **AWS SageMaker Ground Truth:** Helps in going from raw data, to labelled data> It first sends the data to humans for initial labels. Then it trains an ML model based on these initial labels, to automate the labelling process. 
2.
