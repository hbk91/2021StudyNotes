## **Limitations of ChatGPT/LLMs, Solutions, and Businesses:** 

| **Limitation**                          | **Potential Solution**                                                                 | **Businesses trying to Solve it**                                              |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Lack of Spatial Intelligence**     | Develop models with advanced 3D spatial understanding, like Large World Models (LWMs).| World Labs, Nvidia Omniverse, Meta Reality Labs                            |
| **2. Limited Real-Time Decision Making**| Integrate AI with real-time processing systems using edge computing.                  | Nvidia (Jetson), OpenAI (plugins for real-time operations), Tesla FSD      |
| **3. Narrow Multimodal Integration**    | Create models that seamlessly handle text, images, audio, and video data together.    | Google DeepMind, OpenAI (DALL-E and Whisper integrations), RunwayML       |
| **4. Energy-Intensive Training**        | Optimize algorithms for lower energy consumption and use renewable energy sources.    | Cerebras Systems, OpenAI (energy-efficient clusters), Graphcore            |
| **5. Black Box Nature (Lack of Explainability)** | Develop AI systems with inherent interpretability and transparency.                   | Anthropic (AI alignment), DARPA XAI, IBM (Watson Explainable AI)          |
| **6. Limited Domain Expertise**         | Fine-tune large models with domain-specific datasets for better contextual results.   | Jasper AI (marketing), Glean AI (finance), PathAI (healthcare)             |
| **7. Poor Physical Interaction Capability** | Enhance robotics integration with AI for better real-world interaction.               | Boston Dynamics, Waymo, Tesla, OpenAI (robotics experiments)              |
| **8. Inability to Handle Complex Emotions** | Incorporate advancements in affective computing and emotional AI.                     | Affectiva, Cogito, Microsoft (emotional recognition research)             |
| **9. Dependency on Massive Data**       | Use synthetic data generation and few-shot learning to reduce reliance on large datasets.| Datagen, OpenAI (fine-tuning with less data), Google AI                   |
| **10. Security Vulnerabilities**        | Focus on adversarial training and robust cybersecurity frameworks.                    | Microsoft Azure AI, Palantir, MIT Lincoln Labs                            |
