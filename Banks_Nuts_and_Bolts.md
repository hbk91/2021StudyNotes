## **Past Due, Classified, and Non-Performing Loans – What They Mean**

---

### **1. Past Due Loans**

| **Aspect** | **Explanation** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Definition** | Loans where scheduled payments are **late** — typically **30 days or more past due**, but **still accruing interest** if the borrower is expected to catch up. |
| **Purpose** | Serves as an **early warning signal** of repayment issues. |
| **Example** | A borrower misses a payment due on Sept 1 and hasn’t paid by Oct 1 → 30–59 days past due. |
| **Typical Thresholds** | Banks break this down into **30–59 days**, **60–89 days**, and **90+ days** past due. |
| **Accounting Impact** | Still accrues interest income **unless** moved to nonaccrual status. |

---

### **2. Classified Loans**

| **Aspect** | **Explanation** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Definition** | Loans internally or regulatorily flagged as having **potential or well-defined weaknesses**, even if not yet delinquent. |
| **Purpose** | Tracks **credit deterioration** before default — key internal risk-management tool. |
| **Categories (per U.S. regulatory guidance)** | • **Special Mention:** Potential weakness.<br>• **Substandard:** Well-defined weakness jeopardizing repayment.<br>• **Doubtful:** Collection highly questionable.<br>• **Loss:** Considered uncollectible (to be charged off). |
| **Basis for Classification** | Borrower financials, collateral value, covenant compliance, or repayment trends — **not limited to missed payments.** |
| **Accounting Impact** | Often still accruing but with **heightened allowance** for possible loss. |

---

### **3. Non-Performing Loans (NPLs)**

| **Aspect** | **Explanation** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Definition** | Loans that **no longer accrue interest** because **collection is doubtful** or they are **90 + days past due**. |
| **Purpose** | Reflects **confirmed impairment** within the loan portfolio. |
| **Criteria (typical U.S. bank)** | • ≥ 90 days past due and unpaid, **or**<br>• Placed on **nonaccrual status** because full repayment is unlikely. |
| **Accounting Impact** | Interest recognition stops; typically covered by **specific loan-loss allowance** or partial charge-off. |

---

### **Relationship Between Categories**

| **Stage** | **Description** | **Category** |
|------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Payment 30 days late | Borrower behind on payments | **Past Due** |
| Borrower shows strain or covenant breach | Early deterioration but may still be current | **Classified (Special Mention / Substandard)** |
| Borrower stops paying ≥ 90 days | Default, repayment uncertain | **Non-Performing Loan (NPL)** |

> In short, a single loan can **progress from Past Due → Classified → Non-Performing** as conditions worsen.

---

### **How These Are Defined**

| **Source** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Internal Bank Policy** | Each bank sets thresholds (e.g., 30 days = past due; 90 days = nonaccrual). |
| **Regulatory Guidance** | Defined by the **OCC, FDIC, and Federal Reserve** under the *Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management Policy* and *Interagency Guidelines for Credit Risk Review*. |
| **Judgment-Based** | Classification may depend on borrower cash flows, collateral strength, or covenant performance — not just delinquency days. |

---

### **Example – Multi-Family Loan at OBK**

| **Stage** | **Scenario** | **Category** |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| Borrower 40 days late on payment but expected to cure | Slight delinquency | **Past Due (0.36%)** |
| Borrower current but DSCR falling below covenants | Heightened risk | **Classified (Substandard)** |
| Borrower 90 + days unpaid, collateral < loan balance | Default | **Non-Performing (0.36%)** |

---

### **Why These Metrics Matter**

- Indicate **early credit stress** trends before full defaults appear.  
- Inform **loan-loss provisioning** and capital planning.  
- Provide investors and regulators a clear view of **portfolio quality trajectory**.

## **Understanding AOCI in Banks**

---

### ** What is AOCI (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/Loss)?**

**AOCI** is a component of shareholders’ equity that captures **unrealized gains or losses** not yet reflected in the income statement.  
For banks, this mainly comes from **changes in fair value of securities**, but can include other items as well.

---

### ** Major Sources of AOCI in Banks**

| **Source** | **Description** | **Typical Impact** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| **Available-for-Sale (AFS) Securities** | Unrealized gains/losses from changes in market value of bond portfolios marked to fair value under ASC 320. | Usually **largest** driver of AOCI (negative when rates rise). |
| **Derivative / Hedging Adjustments** | Effective portion of cash-flow hedges under ASC 815. | Moderate impact, depending on hedge book. |
| **Pension Adjustments** | Actuarial gains/losses from defined-benefit plans. | Minor for most regional banks. |
| **Foreign Currency Translation** | Exchange-rate changes on foreign subsidiaries. | Minimal for domestic banks. |

---

### ** Why AOCI Matters**

| **Impact Area** | **Explanation** |
|------------------|-----------------|
| **Tangible Book Value (TBV)** | Unrealized losses in AOCI reduce TBV, lowering P/TBV multiples and equity strength. |
| **Regulatory Capital** | Under Basel III:<br>• Large banks include AOCI in CET1.<br>• Community banks can elect to opt out. |
| **Investor Valuation** | Analysts adjust TBV for AOCI to reflect true *economic* equity. |
| **Earnings Volatility** | AOCI shields unrealized mark-to-market swings from hitting EPS until securities are sold. |

---

### ** Example – Origin Bancorp (OBK) Q3 2025**

| **Metric** | **Value** | **Comment** |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| **AOCI Balance** | −$61.2 million | Unrealized bond losses from AFS portfolio. |
| **Securities Yield** | 3.62% | Up from 3.16% in Q2 after repositioning. |
| **Portfolio Duration** | 4.31 years | Moderate rate sensitivity. |
| **Portfolio Mix** | 42% MBS, 26% Municipals, 26% CMOs, 6% Corporate | MBS drives rate sensitivity. |

---

## **Why Analysts Adjust TBV for AOCI**

1. **Reflect Economic Equity:**  
   TBV should represent real shareholder value — unrealized losses in AOCI are real market hits even if not realized.

2. **Purchase Accounting Alignment:**  
   In M&A, all assets and liabilities are marked to fair value. AOCI therefore becomes economically realized at closing.

3. **Peer Comparability:**  
   Banks differ in AFS vs. HTM mix. Adjusting for AOCI ensures all are evaluated on the same marked basis.

---

### **AOCI Treatment in M&A**

| **Step** | **Description** | **Impact on Deal Math** |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------------|
| **1️⃣** | Target’s AFS portfolio holds unrealized losses in AOCI. | TBV already reduced by AOCI. |
| **2️⃣** | Acquirer revalues securities to fair value at closing. | AOCI is wiped out; replaced by fair-value “mark.” |
| **3️⃣** | Mark is amortized (GAAP term) / accreted (economic term) into income over time. | Reduces Day-1 TBV dilution; boosts NII over time. |
| **4️⃣** | Analysts explicitly include this in merger models. | Captures both capital and earnings effects. |

---

### **Example – TowneBank Deal Disclosure**

> **AOCI Securities Mark-Down:** ~$2.7 million amortized over 4 years (straight-line method)

**Interpretation:**
- The target’s AFS book had unrealized losses sitting in AOCI.  
- On closing, those are marked to fair value (−$2.7m).  
- That mark is **amortized** (GAAP term) over 4 years, effectively **accreting back** into NII.

---

### **Modeling Implications**

| **Metric View** | **Meaning** |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Including AOCI** | Reflects *economic* TBV (accounts for unrealized losses). |
| **Excluding AOCI** | Reflects *accounting* TBV (ignores market value). |
| **Day-1 TBV Impact** | Mark reduces tangible equity at closing. |
| **Future Earnings Impact** | Mark reverses (accretes) into income over amortization period. |

---

## **Amortization vs. Accretion – Terminology Clarified**

---

### **Why the Word “Amortization” Is Used**

Even when income **increases** over time (as discounts reverse), GAAP still calls the process **“amortization”** because the effective-yield or straight-line method is used to allocate the fair-value adjustment.

**In other words:**  
> “Amortization” describes the *method*, not the *direction*.

---

### **Economic vs. Accounting View**

| **Perspective** | **Term Used** | **Direction** | **Effect on Income** |
|------------------|---------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **GAAP / Accounting** | Amortization | Applies to both premiums and discounts on assets | Can increase or decrease income |
| **Analyst / Economic** | Accretion | Used when a discount increases income over time | Income rises as discount unwinds |

---

### **Example**

| **Item** | **Fair-Value Mark** | **Accounting Disclosure** | **Economic Description** | **Effect** |
|-----------|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| AFS Securities | −$4.0m | “Amortized over 4 years” | “Accretes back into NII” | +$1.0m income per year |
| Fixed Assets | −$1.0m | “Amortized over 30 years” | Reversal increases noninterest income | Gradual income accretion |

---

## **Amortization vs. Accretion by Balance Sheet Category**

| **Category** | **GAAP Term** | **Direction of Impact** | **Effect on Income** | **Why** |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------|
| **Assets (Loans, Securities, Fixed Assets)** | **Amortization** | Mark-down (discount) → income rises as discount unwinds | **Increases NII** | ASC 310-20 & ASC 805 define effective-yield amortization for assets. |
|  |  | Mark-up (premium) → income falls as premium amortizes | **Decreases NII** | Same method, opposite sign. |
| **Liabilities (Deposits, Borrowings, CDs, FHLB)** | **Accretion** | Mark-down (discount) → liability value grows → cost rises | **Reduces NII** | GAAP uses “accretion of discount” for liabilities approaching par. |
|  |  | Mark-up (premium) → liability amortizes down → cost falls | **Increases NII** | “Accretion” applies in both cases. |

---

### **Shortcut Rule**

| **Item Type** | **Term Always Used** | **Economic Effect** |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Assets** | “Amortized” | Income may increase (discount) or decrease (premium). |
| **Liabilities** | “Accreted” | Cost may increase (discount) or decrease (premium). |

---

### **In a Bank Merger Model**

| **Item** | **Mark Direction** | **GAAP Term** | **Economic Effect** |
|-----------|--------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Securities / Loans | Down (discount) | Amortized | Increases income (accretes). |
| Core Deposits | Up (premium) | Accreted | Reduces income (expense amortizes). |
| Time Deposits / Borrowings | Down (discount) | Accreted | Increases income (lower funding cost). |

---

### **Summary**

| **Concept** | **GAAP Word** | **Economic Word** | **Net Effect on Earnings** |
|--------------|---------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Asset write-down (discount) | Amortization | Accretion | Increases NII |
| Asset write-up (premium) | Amortization | Amortization | Decreases NII |
| Liability discount | Accretion | Accretion | Decreases NII |
| Liability premium | Accretion | Amortization | Increases NII |

---

> **Bottom Line:**  
> - **Assets are always “amortized.”**  
> - **Liabilities are always “accreted.”**  
> - The *economic effect* (income up or down) depends on whether it’s a discount or premium — not on the word itself.
