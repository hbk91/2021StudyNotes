## **Past Due, Classified, and Non-Performing Loans – What They Mean**

---

### **1. Past Due Loans**

| **Aspect** | **Explanation** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Definition** | Loans where scheduled payments are **late** — typically **30 days or more past due**, but **still accruing interest** if the borrower is expected to catch up. |
| **Purpose** | Serves as an **early warning signal** of repayment issues. |
| **Example** | A borrower misses a payment due on Sept 1 and hasn’t paid by Oct 1 → 30–59 days past due. |
| **Typical Thresholds** | Banks break this down into **30–59 days**, **60–89 days**, and **90+ days** past due. |
| **Accounting Impact** | Still accrues interest income **unless** moved to nonaccrual status. |

---

### **2. Classified Loans**

| **Aspect** | **Explanation** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Definition** | Loans internally or regulatorily flagged as having **potential or well-defined weaknesses**, even if not yet delinquent. |
| **Purpose** | Tracks **credit deterioration** before default — key internal risk-management tool. |
| **Categories (per U.S. regulatory guidance)** | • **Special Mention:** Potential weakness.<br>• **Substandard:** Well-defined weakness jeopardizing repayment.<br>• **Doubtful:** Collection highly questionable.<br>• **Loss:** Considered uncollectible (to be charged off). |
| **Basis for Classification** | Borrower financials, collateral value, covenant compliance, or repayment trends — **not limited to missed payments.** |
| **Accounting Impact** | Often still accruing but with **heightened allowance** for possible loss. |

---

### **3. Non-Performing Loans (NPLs)**

| **Aspect** | **Explanation** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Definition** | Loans that **no longer accrue interest** because **collection is doubtful** or they are **90 + days past due**. |
| **Purpose** | Reflects **confirmed impairment** within the loan portfolio. |
| **Criteria (typical U.S. bank)** | • ≥ 90 days past due and unpaid, **or**<br>• Placed on **nonaccrual status** because full repayment is unlikely. |
| **Accounting Impact** | Interest recognition stops; typically covered by **specific loan-loss allowance** or partial charge-off. |

---

### **Relationship Between Categories**

| **Stage** | **Description** | **Category** |
|------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Payment 30 days late | Borrower behind on payments | **Past Due** |
| Borrower shows strain or covenant breach | Early deterioration but may still be current | **Classified (Special Mention / Substandard)** |
| Borrower stops paying ≥ 90 days | Default, repayment uncertain | **Non-Performing Loan (NPL)** |

> In short, a single loan can **progress from Past Due → Classified → Non-Performing** as conditions worsen.

---

### **How These Are Defined**

| **Source** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Internal Bank Policy** | Each bank sets thresholds (e.g., 30 days = past due; 90 days = nonaccrual). |
| **Regulatory Guidance** | Defined by the **OCC, FDIC, and Federal Reserve** under the *Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management Policy* and *Interagency Guidelines for Credit Risk Review*. |
| **Judgment-Based** | Classification may depend on borrower cash flows, collateral strength, or covenant performance — not just delinquency days. |

---

### **Example – Multi-Family Loan at OBK**

| **Stage** | **Scenario** | **Category** |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| Borrower 40 days late on payment but expected to cure | Slight delinquency | **Past Due (0.36%)** |
| Borrower current but DSCR falling below covenants | Heightened risk | **Classified (Substandard)** |
| Borrower 90 + days unpaid, collateral < loan balance | Default | **Non-Performing (0.36%)** |

---

### **Why These Metrics Matter**

- Indicate **early credit stress** trends before full defaults appear.  
- Inform **loan-loss provisioning** and capital planning.  
- Provide investors and regulators a clear view of **portfolio quality trajectory**.

## **Understanding AOCI in Banks**

---

### ** What is AOCI (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/Loss)?**

**AOCI** is a component of shareholders’ equity that captures **unrealized gains or losses** not yet reflected in the income statement.  
For banks, this mainly comes from **changes in fair value of securities**, but can include other items as well.

---

### ** Major Sources of AOCI in Banks**

| **Source** | **Description** | **Typical Impact** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| **Available-for-Sale (AFS) Securities** | Unrealized gains/losses from changes in market value of bond portfolios marked to fair value under ASC 320. | Usually **largest** driver of AOCI (negative when rates rise). |
| **Derivative / Hedging Adjustments** | Effective portion of cash-flow hedges under ASC 815. | Moderate impact, depending on hedge book. |
| **Pension Adjustments** | Actuarial gains/losses from defined-benefit plans. | Minor for most regional banks. |
| **Foreign Currency Translation** | Exchange-rate changes on foreign subsidiaries. | Minimal for domestic banks. |

---

### ** Why AOCI Matters**

| **Impact Area** | **Explanation** |
|------------------|-----------------|
| **Tangible Book Value (TBV)** | Unrealized losses in AOCI reduce TBV, lowering P/TBV multiples and equity strength. |
| **Regulatory Capital** | Under Basel III:<br>• Large banks include AOCI in CET1.<br>• Community banks can elect to opt out. |
| **Investor Valuation** | Analysts adjust TBV for AOCI to reflect true *economic* equity. |
| **Earnings Volatility** | AOCI shields unrealized mark-to-market swings from hitting EPS until securities are sold. |

---

### ** Example – Origin Bancorp (OBK) Q3 2025**

| **Metric** | **Value** | **Comment** |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| **AOCI Balance** | −$61.2 million | Unrealized bond losses from AFS portfolio. |
| **Securities Yield** | 3.62% | Up from 3.16% in Q2 after repositioning. |
| **Portfolio Duration** | 4.31 years | Moderate rate sensitivity. |
| **Portfolio Mix** | 42% MBS, 26% Municipals, 26% CMOs, 6% Corporate | MBS drives rate sensitivity. |

---

## **Why Analysts Adjust TBV for AOCI**

1. **Reflect Economic Equity:**  
   TBV should represent real shareholder value — unrealized losses in AOCI are real market hits even if not realized.

2. **Purchase Accounting Alignment:**  
   In M&A, all assets and liabilities are marked to fair value. AOCI therefore becomes economically realized at closing.

3. **Peer Comparability:**  
   Banks differ in AFS vs. HTM mix. Adjusting for AOCI ensures all are evaluated on the same marked basis.

---

### **AOCI Treatment in M&A**

| **Step** | **Description** | **Impact on Deal Math** |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------------|
| **1️⃣** | Target’s AFS portfolio holds unrealized losses in AOCI. | TBV already reduced by AOCI. |
| **2️⃣
** | Acquirer revalues securities to fair value at closing. | AOCI is wiped out; replaced by fair-value “mark.” |
| **3️⃣** | Mark is amortized (GAAP term) / accreted (economic term) into income over time. | Reduces Day-1 TBV dilution; boosts NII over time. |
| **4️⃣** | Analysts explicitly include this in merger models. | Captures both capital and earnings effects. |

---

### **Example – TowneBank Deal Disclosure**

> **AOCI Securities Mark-Down:** ~$2.7 million amortized over 4 years (straight-line method)

**Interpretation:**
- The target’s AFS book had unrealized losses sitting in AOCI.  
- On closing, those are marked to fair value (−$2.7m).  
- That mark is **amortized** (GAAP term) over 4 years, effectively **accreting back** into NII.

---

### **Modeling Implications**

| **Metric View** | **Meaning** |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Including AOCI** | Reflects *economic* TBV (accounts for unrealized losses). |
| **Excluding AOCI** | Reflects *accounting* TBV (ignores market value). |
| **Day-1 TBV Impact** | Mark reduces tangible equity at closing. |
| **Future Earnings Impact** | Mark reverses (accretes) into income over amortization period. |

---

## **Amortization vs. Accretion – Terminology Clarified**

---

### **Why the Word “Amortization” Is Used**

Even when income **increases** over time (as discounts reverse), GAAP still calls the process **“amortization”** because the effective-yield or straight-line method is used to allocate the fair-value adjustment.

**In other words:**  
> “Amortization” describes the *method*, not the *direction*.

---

### **Economic vs. Accounting View**

| **Perspective** | **Term Used** | **Direction** | **Effect on Income** |
|------------------|---------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **GAAP / Accounting** | Amortization | Applies to both premiums and discounts on assets | Can increase or decrease income |
| **Analyst / Economic** | Accretion | Used when a discount increases income over time | Income rises as discount unwinds |

---

### **Example**

| **Item** | **Fair-Value Mark** | **Accounting Disclosure** | **Economic Description** | **Effect** |
|-----------|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| AFS Securities | −$4.0m | “Amortized over 4 years” | “Accretes back into NII” | +$1.0m income per year |
| Fixed Assets | −$1.0m | “Amortized over 30 years” | Reversal increases noninterest income | Gradual income accretion |

---

## **Amortization vs. Accretion by Balance Sheet Category**

| **Category** | **GAAP Term** | **Direction of Impact** | **Effect on Income** | **Why** |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------|
| **Assets (Loans, Securities, Fixed Assets)** | **Amortization** | Mark-down (discount) → income rises as discount unwinds | **Increases NII** | ASC 310-20 & ASC 805 define effective-yield amortization for assets. |
|  |  | Mark-up (premium) → income falls as premium amortizes | **Decreases NII** | Same method, opposite sign. |
| **Liabilities (Deposits, Borrowings, CDs, FHLB)** | **Accretion** | Mark-down (discount) → liability value grows → cost rises | **Reduces NII** | GAAP uses “accretion of discount” for liabilities approaching par. |
|  |  | Mark-up (premium) → liability amortizes down → cost falls | **Increases NII** | “Accretion” applies in both cases. |

---

### **Shortcut Rule**

| **Item Type** | **Term Always Used** | **Economic Effect** |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Assets** | “Amortized” | Income may increase (discount) or decrease (premium). |
| **Liabilities** | “Accreted” | Cost may increase (discount) or decrease (premium). |

---

### **In a Bank Merger Model**

| **Item** | **Mark Direction** | **GAAP Term** | **Economic Effect** |
|-----------|--------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Securities / Loans | Down (discount) | Amortized | Increases income (accretes). |
| Core Deposits | Up (premium) | Accreted | Reduces income (expense amortizes). |
| Time Deposits / Borrowings | Down (discount) | Accreted | Increases income (lower funding cost). |

---

### **Summary**

| **Concept** | **GAAP Word** | **Economic Word** | **Net Effect on Earnings** |
|--------------|---------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Asset write-down (discount) | Amortization | Accretion | Increases NII |
| Asset write-up (premium) | Amortization | Amortization | Decreases NII |
| Liability discount | Accretion | Accretion | Decreases NII |
| Liability premium | Accretion | Amortization | Increases NII |

---

> **Bottom Line:**  
> - **Assets are always “amortized.”**  
> - **Liabilities are always “accreted.”**  
> - The *economic effect* (income up or down) depends on whether it’s a discount or premium — not on the word itself.

---
---

## **Understanding Bank Deposit Types and Characteristics**

---

### **1️⃣ Overview**

Deposits are the **primary funding source** for a bank.  
From the bank’s perspective, deposits are **liabilities** — funds owed to customers — and thus are often shown as **negative numbers** in presentations.

\[
\text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Equity}
\]

**Deposits = Funding Source (Liability)**  
**Loans/Securities = Uses of Funds (Asset)**

---

## **2️⃣ Key Deposit Categories**

---

### **A. FDIC Insured Deposits**

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Definition** | Balances fully covered by FDIC insurance (up to $250,000 per depositor, per ownership category). |
| **Typical Source** | Retail customers and small businesses. |
| **Behavioral Profile** | **Very stable** – core deposit base. |
| **Cost of Funds** | Low – often noninterest-bearing or low-rate checking/savings. |
| **Regulatory View** | Strongest funding quality. |
| **Accounting Treatment** | Liability; shown as a negative number. |

---

### **B. FDIC Insured Reciprocal Deposits**

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Definition** | Large customer deposits placed via reciprocal networks (e.g., **IntraFi ICS / CDARS**) that are split into smaller insured chunks across participating banks. |
| **Mechanism** | Bank places excess funds with the network and receives an equal amount of reciprocal deposits back from other banks. |
| **Purpose** | Allows customers to maintain **full FDIC coverage** while keeping the relationship with one bank. |
| **Regulatory Treatment** | **Not brokered** if the bank is well-capitalized and within limits (post-2018 FDIC rule). |
| **Behavioral Profile** | **Stable / core-like**, relationship-based. |
| **Cost of Funds** | Slightly higher than retail deposits but cheaper than brokered CDs. |

---

### **C. FDIC Insured Brokered Deposits**

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Definition** | Deposits obtained through third-party brokers or online listing services. |
| **Purpose** | Used to quickly raise liquidity when loan growth exceeds local deposit base. |
| **Regulatory View** | Considered **non-core / volatile** funding. |
| **Behavioral Profile** | **Rate-sensitive** and **flight-prone**. |
| **Cost of Funds** | Higher – requires competitive rates. |
| **Usage Example** | Common in liquidity-stressed banks or rapid balance sheet expansion. |

---

### **D. Public Funds Deposits**

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Definition** | Deposits from **state and local governments, school districts, and other public entities**. |
| **Examples** | City payroll accounts, school district operating funds, or tax receipts. |
| **Legal Requirement** | Must be **fully insured or collateralized** above FDIC limit. |
| **Collateralization** | Pledged securities or FHLB letters of credit. |
| **Behavioral Profile** | **Moderately stable**, but often **seasonal** (tax and budget cycles). |
| **Cost of Funds** | Moderate; priced competitively to attract municipalities. |
| **Liquidity Impact** | Stable but collateralized → reduces balance sheet flexibility. |

---

### **E. Collateralized Deposits**

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Definition** | Deposits backed by pledged assets (U.S. Treasuries, municipal bonds, or FHLB LOCs). |
| **Who Uses Them** | Primarily for **public deposits** above FDIC insurance limits. |
| **Purpose** | Protects depositor in case of bank failure. |
| **Accounting Treatment** | Deposit liability offset by pledged collateral (encumbered asset). |
| **Behavioral Profile** | Stable but **reduces available liquidity** (pledged assets cannot be reused). |
| **Risk Trade-off** | Safer for depositor, costlier for bank liquidity management. |

---

### **F. Uninsured / Uncollateralized Deposits**

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Definition** | Deposits exceeding the $250,000 FDIC insurance limit **and not backed** by pledged collateral. |
| **Typical Source** | Large corporate, commercial, or wealth-management clients. |
| **Behavioral Profile** | **Rate-sensitive and volatile** – most likely to move in stress events. |
| **Risk** | Flight risk during market uncertainty or confidence shocks. |
| **Cost of Funds** | Higher – must offer competitive yields to retain balances. |
| **Analyst Focus** | Tracked closely to gauge potential run-off risk and liquidity exposure. |

---

### **G. Total Estimated FDIC-Insured Deposits**

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Definition** | Combined total of FDIC-insured, reciprocal, and brokered deposits that carry explicit insurance. |
| **Purpose** | Indicates the **insured portion** of total deposit base. |
| **Interpretation** | A higher share = lower liquidity risk. |
| **Typical Ratio** | Healthy regional banks show 40–60% insured deposits. |

---

## **3️⃣ Collateralization Explained**

| **Concept** | **Meaning** |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Collateral Requirement** | Public deposits above FDIC limits must be secured by pledged assets. |
| **Common Collateral Types** | U.S. Treasuries, Agency bonds, Municipals, FHLB letters of credit. |
| **Impact on Liquidity** | Collateral is **encumbered** – cannot be sold or repo’d. |
| **Trade-Off** | Safer for depositor but limits bank’s flexibility. |

---

## **4️⃣ Deposit Composition Example (OBK – Q3 2025)**

| **Category** | **Balance ($000)** | **QoQ %** | **Key Insight** |
|---------------|--------------------|------------|-----------------|
| FDIC Insured | 3,407,017 | +1.0% | Core retail and business deposits. |
| FDIC Insured Reciprocal | 1,056,176 | +6.4% | Full-insurance relationships via ICS/CDARS. |
| FDIC Brokered | 0 | (–100%) | Fully eliminated. |
| Collateralized | 690,933 | –16.8% | Secured public funds using pledged assets. |
| Public Funds | 865,637 | (flat) | Government entities – seasonal. |
| **Uninsured / Uncollateralized** | **3,177,704** | **+9.5%** | Large corporate balances – more volatile. |

---

## **5️⃣ Deposit Type Comparison Summary**

| **Deposit Type** | **FDIC-Insured?** | **Collateral Required?** | **Relationship Depth** | **Funding Stability** | **Liquidity Impact** |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Retail / Consumer | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | High | Very Stable | None |
| Commercial | Partially | ❌ No | High | Stable | None |
| Public Funds | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (above limit) | Medium | Moderately Stable | Encumbers collateral |
| Reciprocal | ✅ Fully | ❌ No | High | Stable | None |
| Brokered | ✅ Fully | ❌ No | Low | Volatile | None |
| Collateralized | ✅/Secured | ✅ Yes | Medium | Stable | Reduces liquidity |
| Uninsured / Uncollateralized | ❌ No | ❌ No | Medium | Volatile / Flighty | None |

---

## **6️ Key Takeaways**

- **Deposits are liabilities** — shown as negatives because they’re owed to customers.  
- **Public funds** are government deposits that must be **insured or collateralized**.  
- **Collateralized deposits** are safe for depositors but **consume liquidity** (pledged assets unavailable).  
- **Reciprocal deposits** (ICS/CDARS) are insured and relationship-based — **core-like**.  
- **Uninsured deposits** are the most **rate-sensitive** and **least stable**.  
- Strong banks monitor mix of **insured vs. uninsured** and **collateralized vs. free** deposits to manage liquidity and cost of funds.

---

> **Analyst Insight:**  
> When evaluating a bank’s funding profile, focus on:  
> - % of **insured deposits** (stability)  
> - % of **uninsured / uncollateralized** (run risk)  
> - Level of **collateral encumbrance** (liquidity constraint)  
> - Trends in **reciprocal deposits** (relationship strength)

| **d = (a + b)/c** | **Coverage Ratio** | **1.60×** |

##  **What It Measures**

It measures how much **available liquidity** a bank has relative to its **uninsured, non-collateralized deposits** — i.e., the most flight-prone funding source.

> **Interpretation:**  
> For every $1 of uninsured, non-collateralized deposits, the bank holds $1.60 of available liquidity.

---

##  **Why It Matters**

| **Aspect** | **Explanation** |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Post-SVB Focus** | After 2023’s banking turmoil, investors track uninsured deposit exposure closely. |
| **Liquidity Stress Test Proxy** | Tests whether the bank could cover a rapid outflow of uninsured deposits. |
| **Regulatory Lens** | A non-LCR ratio used by community/regional banks to signal resilience. |
| **Investor Comfort** | Ratios >1.0× suggest enough coverage for high-stress withdrawal scenarios. |

---

##  **Components Explained**

| **Component** | **Nature** | **Liquidity Speed** |
|----------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Cash & Cash Equivalents (b)** | Immediate funds held on balance sheet. | Same-day |
| **Unpledged AFS Securities** | Securities available for sale or repo. | Within 1–2 days |
| **FHLB Borrowing Availability** | Secured funding line from Federal Home Loan Bank. | Within hours |
| **Fed Funds Lines & Discount Window** | Emergency access to Federal Reserve liquidity. | Same-day |
| **Uninsured, Non-Collateralized Deposits (c)** | Deposits above FDIC insurance cap, unpledged. | Can leave quickly |

---

##  **Typical Ranges**

| **Coverage Ratio** | **Interpretation** |
|--------------------:|-------------------|
| **>1.5×** | Very strong liquidity; ample cushion. |
| **1.0–1.5×** | Adequate coverage; manageable stress scenario. |
| **<1.0×** | Tight liquidity; would require asset sales or external funding. |

OBK’s **1.60×** ratio indicates a **strong liquidity position**.

---

##  **Summary Table**

| **Metric** | **Definition** | **Formula** | **3Q25 Value** | **Meaning** |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|----------------:|--------------|
| **Coverage Ratio** | Available liquidity vs. uninsured deposits | (FHLB + Unpledged AFS + Fed Lines + Cash) ÷ Uninsured deposits | **1.60×** | OBK holds $1.60 of accessible liquidity for every $1 of uninsured deposits. |

---

##  **Analyst Tip**

> **Rule of Thumb:** Coverage Ratio ≥ **1.25×** is considered healthy.  
> Below 1× means the bank could **not fully cover** its uninsured outflows without outside funding.  
> The higher the ratio, the greater the **liquidity resiliency** and **regulatory comfort**.

## **Understanding the Statement of Comprehensive Income vs. Income Statement (Using Origin Bancorp Example)**

---

## Core Difference

| **Statement** | **What It Shows** | **Scope** |
|----------------|------------------|------------|
| **Income Statement** (Statement of Income) | Performance from **operating activities** — revenues, expenses, provisions, and taxes. | **Net Income** (bottom line of core profitability). |
| **Statement of Comprehensive Income** | Includes **Net Income + Other Comprehensive Income (OCI)** — changes in equity from non-owner sources. | **Comprehensive Income** (total change in equity excluding capital actions). |

\[
\text{Comprehensive Income} = \text{Net Income} + \text{Other Comprehensive Income (OCI)}
\]

---

## Why Banks Need a Separate “Comprehensive” Statement

Banks hold large portfolios of **Available-for-Sale (AFS) securities**, **derivatives**, and **hedges**, which are *marked to market*.  
Changes in their fair value affect **shareholders’ equity**, but **not net income** — unless the securities are sold.  

Therefore, GAAP requires these unrealized gains/losses to be reported in **Other Comprehensive Income (OCI)**.

---

## How the Two Statements Flow Together

| **Category** | **Appears in Income Statement?** | **Appears in OCI (Comprehensive Statement)?** | **Example (OBK 3Q25)** |
|---------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Interest income / expense | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | $100.8M Net interest income |
| Provision for credit losses | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | $36.8M provision |
| Operating expenses | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Salaries, occupancy, etc. |
| **Unrealized gain/loss on AFS securities** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | $15.8M gain in OCI |
| **Cash flow hedge gains/losses** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | $(70)k adjustment |
| **Tax effects on above items** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | $3.3M tax expense on AFS gain |
| **Net income (bottom line)** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Used as starting point |
| **Comprehensive income (final line)** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (Net Income + OCI) | $21.0M total comprehensive income |

---

## Typical Components of OCI for a Bank

| **OCI Item** | **Source** | **Why It’s in OCI (not Net Income)** |
|---------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Unrealized gains/losses on AFS securities** | Mark-to-market changes in AFS portfolio | Not realized through sale yet |
| **Unrealized gains/losses on cash flow hedges** | Derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk | Hedge accounting rules defer recognition |
| **Foreign currency translation adjustments** | For foreign operations (not relevant for OBK) | Non-cash, unrealized impact |
| **Pension plan adjustments** | Actuarial changes in defined-benefit plans | Long-term, not core earnings |

---

## Link to AOCI (Balance Sheet)

Everything reported under **Other Comprehensive Income (OCI)** **accumulates** into  
**AOCI (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income)** within **Shareholders’ Equity** on the balance sheet.

\[
\text{Ending AOCI (Balance Sheet)} = \text{Beginning AOCI} + \text{Current Period OCI (Statement of Comprehensive Income)}
\]

OCI affects **equity** (and thus Tangible Common Equity and TBVPS) — even though it doesn’t affect **earnings**.

---

## Summary Table

| **Aspect** | **Income Statement** | **Comprehensive Income Statement** |
|-------------|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Measure *profitability* from operations. | Measure *total change in equity* from all sources except capital actions. |
| **Includes** | Revenues, expenses, provision, taxes. | Net income + OCI (AFS, hedges, etc.). |
| **Output** | Net Income. | Comprehensive Income. |
| **Impacts** | Earnings (EPS, ROAA). | Equity (AOCI, TBVPS). |
| **Used for** | Valuation & P/E analysis. | Capital strength & TBV analysis. |
| **OBK Example (3Q25)** | Net income $8.6M | OCI $12.4M → Comprehensive income $21.0M. |

---

### Analyst Tip

> The **Income Statement tells you what the bank *earned.***  
> The **Comprehensive Income Statement tells you what the bank *is worth more or less* by — even before those gains/losses are realized.**

That’s why analysts often **adjust TBV for AOCI**, but **not EPS**, because AOCI changes **capital**, not **earnings**.
